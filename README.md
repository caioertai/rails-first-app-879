# Adding a feature

- 1. Missing route -> Go to config/routes.rb and add it ( get "/about", to: "pages#about" )
- 2. Missing controller -> Use the generator in terminal ( rails g controller pages )
- 3. Missing action -> Add the action (method) to the controller. ( def the method )
- 4. Missing view -> Add a file app/views/controller_name/action_name.html.erb
